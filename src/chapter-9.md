* **Conflicts of interest:** Conflicts of interest can occur when an employee's personal interests conflict with the interests of the organization.
* **Misuse of resources:** Misuse of organizational resources, such as time or money, can be viewed as unethical behavior.

* **Providing training:** Employers can provide training to help employees understand ethical issues and make responsible decisions.
* **Encouraging open communication:** Employers must encourage open communication among employees and create an environment where employees feel comfortable discussing ethical concerns.

Understanding and managing diversity in the workplace involves creating a work environment that promotes inclusivity and respects the unique perspectives and contributions of all employees. Strategies for managing diversity in the workplace include:
